# avg location

For now, create an input file in the style of locations.tsv.  
Can analyze using the python notebook or R script.  Both will 
produce a scatter plot of lat/long points, sized by the amount 
of time spent at that location, with a red star at the average 
location over time.  

To do: 
- plot on map
- script fetching of lat/long from Google Maps via API
- make script command line runnable (three args: file, outliers, cutoff)
- scrape hockeyreference to create average location for nhl player
